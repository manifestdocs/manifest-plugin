## Steps

1. Get the project for the current working directory:

   - Call `find_features` with `project_id` and `query` set to `$ARGUMENTS`
   - If no matches found, tell the user and suggest checking spelling or using `/manifest:tree`

3. If multiple matches, list them and ask which one:
   ```
   Found N features matching "[query]":
   1. [Title] ([state])
   2. [Title] ([state])

   Which feature would you like to see details for?
   ```

4. Get full feature details:
