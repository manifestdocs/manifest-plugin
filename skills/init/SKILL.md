Initialize Manifest for a new or existing codebase. Adapts the flow based on project size: greenfield, small/medium, or large/monorepo.

## Steps

### 1. Check if already initialized

- Call `list_projects` with `directory_path` set to the current working directory
- If a project is found, tell the user:
  ```
  This directory is already linked to project "[Name]".
  Use /manifest:tree to see features or /manifest:plan to add new ones.
  ```
- Exit early if already initialized
- If no project found for this directory, call `list_projects` (no filter) to check for existing projects
- If existing projects are found, ask:
  ```
  Found existing project(s): [list names]

  Is this directory part of one of these projects (monorepo)?
  1. Yes, add it to [project name]
  2. No, create a new project
  ```
- If the user picks an existing project, call `add_project_directory` with `project_id` and `path` set to the current working directory, then exit early with:
  ```
  Linked [directory] to project "[Name]".
  Use /manifest:tree to see features.
  ```

### 2. Analyze and create project

- Call `init_project` with `directory_path` set to the current working directory and `skip_default_versions` set to `true`
- This creates the project, links the directory, and returns analysis with size signals

### 3. Classify project size

From the analysis response, classify the project:

- **GREENFIELD**: `commit_count == 0` OR `file_count < 10`
- **LARGE**: `commit_count > 500` OR `modules` array length > 50 OR `has_subprojects == true`
- **SMALL/MEDIUM**: everything else

### 4. Branch by classification

#### GREENFIELD path

Tell the user:
```
This is a new project. Let's set up your roadmap.
```

- Ask version naming (see Version Naming section below)
- Create 3 versions in order:
  1. `[user input]` - "Now" (current focus)
  2. `[next version]` - "Next"
  3. `Backlog` - "Later"
- Display summary, then:
  ```
  Want to plan features? Run /manifest:plan
  ```

#### SMALL/MEDIUM path

Tell the user:
```
Detected [language] project with [N] modules and [N] commits.
```

- Ask: is this a new or existing codebase?
  ```
  Is this:
  1. A new project (starting fresh)
  2. An existing codebase (has features already built)
  ```

- Ask version naming (see below)
- **For new projects (3 versions):**
  1. `[user input]` - "Now" (current focus)
  2. `[next version]` - "Next"
  3. `Backlog` - "Later"
- **For existing codebases (4 versions):**
  - Ask: "What version represents the features already built?" (suggest: `v0.0.x` or `Shipped`)
  - Create versions in order:
    1. `[existing version]` - released immediately
    2. `[user input]` - "Now"
    3. `[next version]` - "Next"
    4. `Backlog` - "Later"
- Display summary, then:
  ```
  Want to plan? I can analyze your codebase. Run /manifest:plan
  ```

#### LARGE path

Tell the user:
```
This is a sizable project ([N] commits, [N] modules).
```

**If `has_subprojects` is true:**

Show the detected subprojects and ask how to organize:
```
Detected subprojects:
  1. [subproject_paths[0]] ([language/framework])
  2. [subproject_paths[1]] ([language/framework])
  ...

How would you like to organize this?
A) Separate projects per module
   Each gets its own feature tree and versions.
   Best for: independent teams, separate deploy cycles.
B) One project with module grouping
   Single feature tree with top-level features per module.
   Best for: tightly coupled modules, single release cycle.
C) Choose specific modules to track
```

- **Option A**: For each selected subproject, call `init_project` with `directory_path` set to that subproject's absolute path and `skip_default_versions` set to `true`. Then create versions for each.
- **Option B**: Keep the single project already created. Call `add_project_directory` for each subproject path.
- **Option C**: Present the list, let user select, then proceed with A or B for selected modules.

**If NOT `has_subprojects` (just large):**

```
For the initial analysis, I recommend focusing on recent activity rather than the full history.

How far back should I look?
- "6 months" (recent work)
- A git tag like "v2.0" (since a release)
- "all" (full history)
```

Store the user's answer as `since` scope for the plan skill.

- Ask version naming + create versions (same as small/medium existing path)
- Display summary with scoping info

### 5. Display summary

```
Project initialized: [Name]

Versions created:
[If existing]: -- [existing] (released) - for existing features
* [now] (Now) - current focus
  [next] (Next) - up next
  Backlog (Later) - future ideas

Next steps:
- /manifest:plan to design your feature tree
- /manifest:tree to see what exists
```

### 6. Handoff to plan

End with:
```
Want me to help plan features now? Run /manifest:plan
```

Output scoping context as structured text that the plan skill can reference:
```
Initialization context:
- Classification: [greenfield/small_medium/large]
- Since: [git ref or null]
- Focused directories: [paths or null]
```

## Version Naming

Before asking the user, try to detect the current version:
- Check git tags: run `git tag --sort=-v:refname` and look for semver patterns (v1.2.3, 1.2.3)
- Check package manifests: `version` field in Cargo.toml, package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.
  (the analysis response may include this in `name`/`description` or project metadata)

If a version is detected, suggest it:
```
It looks like you're on [detected version].
What version are you working toward next? (e.g., [next increment])
```

If no version is detected, ask from scratch:
```
What version are you working toward?

Examples:
- "0.1.0" or "v0.1.0" (semantic versioning)
- "1.0" (simple numbering)
- "MVP" or "Beta" (milestone names)

This will be your "Now" version - the current focus.
```

When creating the "Next" version, apply these heuristics:

- `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0`
- `1.0` -> `1.1`
- `v1` -> `v2`
- `MVP` -> `Post-MVP`
- `Beta` -> `v1.0`
- If unsure, ask the user

## Notes

- The first unreleased version becomes "Now" (current focus)
- The second unreleased version becomes "Next"
- Order matters: create versions in chronological order
- For existing codebases, the "existing features" version should be released immediately so it doesn't show as "Now"
- Use `skip_default_versions: true` when calling `init_project` so the skill controls version creation
